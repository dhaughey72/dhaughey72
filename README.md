I'm Dakotah Haughey, and I'm currently attending Northwest Missouri State University. I work on campus in Colden Hall, off campus at A&G restaraunt, and I am majoring in Computer Science: Digital Media. Right now, I am taking classes on app and game development, and I'd love to persue something similar in the future.
