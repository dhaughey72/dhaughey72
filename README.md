## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dakotah Haughey, and I'm currently attending Northwest Missouri State University. 

I work on campus in Colden Hall, off campus at A&G restaraunt, and I am majoring in Computer Science: Digital Media. 

Right now, I am taking classes on app and game development, and I'd love to persue something similar in the future!

You can contact me at **s541027@nwmissouri.edu**!
